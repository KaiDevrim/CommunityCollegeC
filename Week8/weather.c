/*
 * Create a constant variable for the file name
 * Then make an array for each month.
 * Then make a constant int for the line length
 * Then make a structure for the data, setting
 * the following data
 *
 * The year, month, and day as an int
 * The max and min as double
 *
 * In the main function open the input file
 * and test if it can open, if not then
 * throw an error. Else open the file
 * and perform the rest of the operations.
 *
 * Then ask for the file name and repeat
 * if it cannot open the file. Then
 * open the file that was created and do the
 * following on it.
 *
 * Write the header to the file.
 * Make two data structs and two doubles
 * for average min and max.
 * Then loop through each line of the file
 * and set the previous.day to current.day
 * unless it is the next month. Then keep
 * checking if the previous.month
 * is equal to the current.month and if it
 * is then increase previous.month by 1.
 * Then calculate the min and max averages
 * and write it to the file.
 * Loop through the file until the end of the file.
